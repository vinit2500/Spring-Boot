+++++++++++++++++++++ FILE SYSTEMS +++++++++++++++++++++

Data => some important useful piece of information that give some collective analysis
        about any particular field.

File Based System -> earlier file based system was used for storing data before databases.
Issues in file based system
-> Data redundancy
   suppose school teacher maintain student marks in excel now incharge says give me data of top 10 student on
   basis of marks. so teacher will copy paste top 10 students in new excel sheet and give it to incharge.
-> Data inconsistency
   Now suppose one student came to teacher and says please update my marks there was some mistake so now teacher
   will update marks on his own sheet but what about incharge sheet.
-> Difficult data access
   suppose we interact through app, website of school but don't know marks is coming from updated sheet or not.
-> Security
   earlier was security issues with excel like anyone can update data or ...

+++++++++++++++++++++ DATABASES +++++++++++++++++++++

Databases => it is collection of related data.
-> what does related data means like in university data there will be student name, age, enrollment no ....
   it can not contains student salary means it is not related data.
-> helps to solve problem of redundency , inconsistency
-> you can integrate any application with database means from same database we are showing data to mobile app
   and website also.


+++++++++++++++++++++ DBMS +++++++++++++++++++++

DBMS => DBMS is a kind of layer between your actual stored database and applications.
-> DBMS provides software to process queries
-> DBMS provides software to access data
-> DBMS is kind of collection of programs or we can say that it is kind of like management system.
   what does it manage it manages a database
   OR
-> DBMS is a kind of management system software that gives us functionality which we can easily query some
   data in database, process some data, add , update , fetch some data.
-> The goal of DBMS is to make sure that reterival and the storage of the information from user to the stored
   database is as smooth as possible.
-> DBMS is set of software or interface between user and database.
-> that's why we called as DBMS.

+++++++++++++++++++++ WHAT IS SQL +++++++++++++++++++++
Mysql, pgsql, oraclesql this are actually database management system softwares.
Mysql, pgsql, oraclesql => they understand one common language SQL(structed query language) so they all can interact
                           using SQL

+++++++++++++++++++++ FEATURES WITH DBMS +++++++++++++++++++++
constraints => limitation or conditions when you store data
-> Sharing the data is very easy
-> we can also apply constraint suppose in excel sheet marks can be added negative but in database not
   if constraint is there.


+++++++++++++++++++++ RDBMS +++++++++++++++++++++
Types of DBMS

1)RDBMS => which stores data in tabular format.
 table -> represents collection of entities
 column -> represents properties of entities
 row -> represents actual data of an entity
