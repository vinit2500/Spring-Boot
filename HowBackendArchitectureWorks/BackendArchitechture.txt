          #first we need to understand client server architecture
          what is client?
          client => client is anything where users can interact for providing info & collecting output.
             ex => mobile apps, web apps, desktop app, watch apps.
          Not one defination
          another defination of client => any service which is capable of raising a request for a process to happen.
             ex => Bank EMI we do not need to pay emi on bank app it automatically detect.

          ex => Loan provider Bank of barodra
                your account on HDFC bank
                then on month starting BOB automatically request to HDFC bank without your interaction.
                -> Jo kch particular time peroid pe request kr rha hai woh bhi client hai

          what is server?
          Server => any machine or a process in the machine which can collect requests process them  & give response.
          -> we can setup our own server in our own machine
          -> like above example HDFC is a server and BOB is a client.

          This client server combination lays down the foundation of client server architechture.
          when we open zomato and search for restraurent in this case our mobile phone is client.

A => we hit www.google.com
     first thing => it is something like this https://www.google.com internally add https:
     -> in new laptop when we type bookMyShow in browser so is bookMyShow home page present in your laptop of couse not
     -> so where this is present it is present in bookMyShow server this server can be present at remote location
     -> this servers will be actual machine on which some logic google, bookMyShow all of this kind of this applications
        have actually deployed which is capable of collecting requests and sending response back.
     -> computer network => two or more computer can connect each other can share resources. ex => mobile hotspot
     -> Internet => Internet is a network of computer networks that has been prepared for so very long period of time.
     -> Engineers host their application on internet. and through IP address we identify application in network.
     -> IP address => IP address helps to identify network or machine inside a network.

     when we write www.google.com => this request does not directly go to server instead it goes to DNS(domain name servers)
     DNS tries to map the domain name to the corresponding IP address and send you back the IP address that you are looking for to the browser.
     then using that IP address browser try to communicate the server of instagram,google...
     DNS tells us that for every particular domain what is the corresponding IP address.

     dig command of linux => dig {domainName} or dig google.com will return IP address of google.

     we have laptop of 8 GB now we need 16 GB so we have upgrade from 8 to 16 this is vertical scaling.
     Issue 1 => there is a limit like beyond limit we can't extend.

     so we comes to horizontal scaling instead of buying a more powerful machine(app server) we buy multiple machine of mediaocur power.

     LOAD BALANCER => distribute request into multiple machine(app server).
     Depends on traffic what we have to do horizontal or vertical.
     Cloud services provides both the scaling like AWS.
